SOMA **automatically transforms raw marker-based mocap point clouds** (black dots in the back) into **solved SMPL-X bodies** and **labeled markers** (colored dots).

## Installation

SOMA is originally developed in Python 3.7, PyTorch 1.8.2 LTS, for Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS. 
Below we prepare the python environment using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), 
however, we opt for a simple pip package manager for installing dependencies.

````
sudo apt install libatlas-base-dev
sudo apt install libpython3.7
sudo apt install libtbb2

conda create -n soma python=3.7 
conda install -c conda-forge ezc3d

pip3 install torch==1.8.2+cu102 torchvision==0.9.2+cu102 torchaudio==0.8.2 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/lts/1.8/torch_lts.html

````
ezc3d installation is currently not supported by pip.

Assuming that you have already cloned this repository to your local drive 
go to the root directory of SOMA code and run
````
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py develop
````
Copy the precompiled 
[smpl-fast-derivatives](https://download.is.tue.mpg.de/download.php?domain=soma&sfile=smpl-fast-derivatives.tar.bz2) 
into your python site-packages folder, i.e. ````anaconda3/envs/soma/lib/python3.7/site-packages````.
The final directory should look like ````anaconda3/envs/soma/lib/python3.7/site-packages/psbody/smpl````.

Install the psbody.mesh library following the instructions in [https://github.com/MPI-IS/mesh](https://github.com/MPI-IS/mesh).
Hint: clone the mesh repository and run the following from the anaconda environment:  ````python setup.py install ````.

To use the rendering capabilities first install an instance of Blender-2.83 LTS on your machine.
Afterward uncompress contents of the precompiled 
[bpy-2.83](https://download.is.tue.mpg.de/download.php?domain=soma&sfile=blender/bpy-2.83-20200908.tar.bz2) 
into your python site-packages folder, i.e. ````anaconda3/envs/soma/lib/python3.7/site-packages````. 

Last but not least, the current SOMA code relies on [MoSh++](https://github.com/nghorbani/moshpp) mocap solver. 
Please install MoSh++ following the guidelines in its repository.


## Using SOMA
There are multiple main parts of the codebase that we try to explain in the [Tutorials](src/tutorials):
- [Run SOMA On MoCap Point Cloud Data](src/tutorials/run_soma_on_soma_dataset.ipynb)
- [Label Priming an Unknown Marker Layout](src/tutorials/label_priming.ipynb)
- [SOMA Ablative Studies](src/tutorials/ablation_study.ipynb)
- [Solve Already Labeled MoCaps With MoSh++](src/tutorials/solve_labeled_mocap.ipynb)
