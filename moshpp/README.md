## Description

This repository holds the code for MoSh++, introduced in [AMASS](http://amass.is.tue.mpg.de/), ICCV'19.
MoSh++ is the upgraded version of [MoSh](https://ps.is.mpg.de/publications/loper-sigasia-2014), Sig.Asia'2014.
Given a *labeled* marker-based motion capture (mocap) c3d file and the *correspondences* 
of the marker labels to the locations on the body, MoSh can
return model parameters for every frame of the mocap sequence. 
The current MoSh++ code works with the following models:

- [SMPL](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/)
- [SMPL+H](http://mano.is.tue.mpg.de/)
- [SMPL-X](https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/)
- [MANO](http://mano.is.tue.mpg.de/)
- [Objects](https://grab.is.tue.mpg.de/)
- [SMALL](https://smal.is.tue.mpg.de/)

## Installation


The Current repository requires Python 3.7 and chumpy; a CPU based auto-differentiation package.
This package is assumed to be used along with [SOMA](https://github.com/nghorbani/soma), the mocap auto-labeling package.
Please install MoSh++ inside the conda environment of SOMA.
Clone the moshpp repository, and run the following from the root directory:

```
sudo apt install libtbb-dev

pip install -r requirements.txt

cd src/moshpp/scan2mesh
sudo apt install libeigen3-dev
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. sudo apt install libtbb-dev
cd mesh_distance
make

cd ../../../..
python setup.py install
```

## Tutorials
This repository is a complementary package to [SOMA](https://soma.is.tue.mpg.de/), an automatic mocap solver.
Please refer to the [SOMA repository](https://github.com/nghorbani/soma) for tutorials and use cases.
